        Best practices:
        - Memory leaks in useEffect and event listeners

        Performance:
        - Use FlatList/SectionList for lists (never ScrollView with .map)
        - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback where appropriate

        TypeScript:
        - Avoid 'any', use explicit types
        - Prefer 'import type' for type imports

    # Asset files (images, fonts, etc.)
    - path: "assets/**/*"
      instructions: |
        Review asset files for:
        - Image optimization (size and format appropriate for mobile)
        - Proper @2x and @3x variants for different screen densities
        - SVG assets are optimized
        - Font files are licensed and optimized
